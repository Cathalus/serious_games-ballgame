# Ball-Game

This is a small Unity3D Game Prototype that was created in 3 Days within the scope of the serious games course at the University of Ulm in 2015.

The player controls a ball which has to navigate through a set of platforming levels with several collectable items. The levels are restricted by a timer and the player is required to collect several Keys to advance to the next level.
